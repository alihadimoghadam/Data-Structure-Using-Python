    Perform Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes.

    Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edges.

    Characteristics:
    - Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V) using a priority queue (V = vertices, E = edges).
    - Space Complexity: O(V) (to store distances and priority queue).
    - Works for graphs with non-negative weights.

    Args:
    graph (dict): An adjacency list representation of a weighted graph {node: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}.
    start (any): The starting node.

    Returns:
    dict: Shortest distance from start node to each node.
