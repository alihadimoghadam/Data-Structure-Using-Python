def bellman_ford(graph, start):
    """
    Perform the Bellman-Ford Algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to all other nodes.

    The Bellman-Ford Algorithm is a dynamic programming approach that:
    1. Iterates V-1 times (where V = number of vertices) to relax all edges.
    2. Detects negative weight cycles in a final iteration.
    3. Works even with negative edge weights (unlike Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm).

    Characteristics:
    - Time Complexity: O(V * E) (V = vertices, E = edges).
    - Space Complexity: O(V) (to store distances).
    - Works with **negative weights** and **detects negative cycles**.

    Args:
    graph (list): A list of edges represented as (source, destination, weight).
    start (any): The starting node.

    Returns:
    tuple: A dictionary with shortest distances and a boolean indicating if a negative cycle is detected.
