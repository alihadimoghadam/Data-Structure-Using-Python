    """
    Perform Prim's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

    Primâ€™s Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that:
    1. Starts with an arbitrary node.
    2. Grows the MST by adding the smallest weight edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited node.
    3. Repeats until all nodes are included in the MST.

    Characteristics:
    - Time Complexity: O(E log V) using a priority queue (E = edges, V = vertices).
    - Space Complexity: O(V) (to store visited nodes and priority queue).
    - Ensures that the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is connected and minimal.

    Args:
    graph (dict): An adjacency list representation of a weighted graph {node: [(neighbor, weight), ...]}.
    start (any): The starting node.

    Returns:
    list: The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) as a list of edges.
