# Initialize BST
bst = BinarySearchTree()

# Insert elements
elements = [50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]
for elem in elements:
    bst.insert(elem)

# Search for elements
print(bst.search(40))  # True
print(bst.search(90))  # False

# Get sorted elements (inorder traversal)
print(bst.inorder_traversal())  # [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
